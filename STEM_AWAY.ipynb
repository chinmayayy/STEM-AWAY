In the example, we use counter, which we had defined as being equal to 0. 2 - Second you pick a condition for the loop to stop: otherwise it would be infinite. In the example, we have counter < 10 which means once counter is 10 or higher, the loop will stop. Why 10 stops it? Because 10 < 10 is false! 10 is not smaller than 10, it’s equal to it. 3 - Third and last part, how to modify the counter after each loop iteration. Once the code inside the loop is run, this part will execute. In the example, we make counter = counter + 1, so we are increment the value of our counter by 1. Without this, we would never reach the stop condition of the second part of the loop definition. You might say: I usually see this! for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) If you pay attention, you’ll realize it’s all the same, just in a more compact form. First part declares the variable that will start counting and it’s starting value (in this case i starting at zero), second part states the stopping logic (keep going as long as i is smaller than 10), and the third part updates the counter value after each iteration (i++ is the short version of doing i = i + 1 ) Another note: all of the three pieces that make up the for loop definition are up to you! For example: let listOfNumbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]; for (let i = 0; i < listOfNumbers.length; i = i +2){   console.log(listOfNumbers[i]; }  // output 1 3 5 6 Here I decided to start my counter at zero, but then I used the .length of the array of numbers to decide where to stop my loop. Since the array has 7 elements, listOfNumbers.length equals 7, and that second statement can be understood as i < 7. The third part increases my counter by 2 every loop. That’s why the output skips every other number. It can help to write it down step by step: 1st iteration: i = 0 check condition: 0 < 7 ? yes, so run the code inside the loop console.log(listOfNumbers[0]; loop if finished, run i = i + 2;  2nd iteration: i = 2 check condition: 2 < 7 ? yes, so run the code inside the loop console.log(listOfNumbers[2]; loop if finished, run i = i + 2;  3rd iteration: i = 4 check condition: 4 < 7 ? yes, so run the code inside the loop console.log(listOfNumbers[4]; loop if finished, run i = i + 2;  4th iteration: i = 6 check condition: 6 < 7 ? yes, so run the code inside the loop console.log(listOfNumbers[6]; loop if finished, run i = i + 2;  5th iteration: i = 8 check condition: 8 < 7 ? No, exit the loop without running code']\n",

I am working through the front end career path and am at 30%. learning the JS is probably faster for me-- I approximate that it takes me about 30s-1 min to really understand new syntax (like let vs var vs const or the arrow inline function declaration syntax) and 2 min for algorithmic concepts like Array,prototype.reduce(), any of the lodash method implementations or other algorithms. However, I have been programming in java and c++ and python for some time! If js is your first programming language, then the concepts are completely new to you and far less intuitive than someone who knows a few more languages already. The position you find yourself in right now is one where you are learning more rapidly than any seasoned programmer. Your learning curve is logistic growth and your intuition and completion time for coding tasks is the inverse of your learning curve. Don’t worry. JS is your template for learning all coding languages in the abstract! Also, know that vanilla javascript is much harder to use than javascript with a library like jquery. Tips: Just One. Indisputably: The Best Way To Become A Better Programmer is to program…(on a team or by yourself locally with no scaffolding provided by an integrated learning environment (such as codecademy) ) If you were to create a project on your computer within an IDE like VS code and you created a html file a css file and a js file and you linked them all to your html file, and you completed a super simple interactive web page, then you will have learned by doing–the best way to learn. And you will have integrated all of your languages and also implemented a major application of Separation of Concerns, Debugged probably using devtools, familiarized yourself more with html css and javascript, synthesized all three languages into DOM nodes like a style.color:Maroon.addEventListener(“click”, callbackFn) – a maroon button that executes a function on clicking (you can see this is a compound element that is part css part html part javascript) ; most importantly, you will have worked on what is ultimately one of many attempts at what you will be producing professionally as a web developer.

Edit: plt.show() is designed to prevent the script continuing (it blocks further execution) matplotlib.pyplot.show — Matplotlib 3.4.2 documentation in the normal “non-interactive mode”. How are you running this code at the minute? By and large matplotlib is designed to run in an interactive session; when the python script finishes exectuion all active matplotlib windows could be closed again without your input. This would appear like the script ran successfully (no errors) but you don’t see any plots, or they flash up very quickly and disappear. Edit: Being lazy with links the first time around; I should probably mention that an interactive shell is generally suggested for working with matploblib but matplotlib’s interactive mode is not the same thing. It’s very likely you’ll want to work in an interactive shell when starting out (unless you’re doing some form of batch processing or periodic figure creation there’s few reasons not to), you might want to work in interactive mode. Try running with python -i (interactive inspection after running script) just to double check the graph appears. This is just a quick test rather than an ideal way of working. If it is not working then you may need to change the backend (some of these require additional downloads from pip or anaconda) https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/usage.html#backends 1 Long term you may prefer working with an interactive kernel like IPython instead of the standard python interactive interpreter. If you’re doing this a lot then you may also prefer changing to use Jupyter’s interactive IDE or something similar which is almost always a much nicer way of working like this.

First: chip8144226952: the const object that = the parameter object, So that would be this: const { name, value } = target; That’s called destructuring assignment, a fancy name to say that you, at the same time, extract a value and assign it to a variable/const. Please do take a minute to read (and practice a bit with) this and particularly this part. Next: chip8144226952: the …prev I still haven’t reached to hooks, but I assume they may be similar to setState (which I have already learned). Please anyone correct me if this is wrong. I am trying to help but I am still a learner here. If this is a similar case, then, I can comment that there are two possible ways to use the setState functions to update the state without mutating it. The most popular way of passing an object would be: setState({ // the updates key(s) and value(s) go(es) here }) Then, there is still another way, which is passing a function instead of an object as parameter, and using the previous state as an arg for that function: setState(prevStateHere => {     ...prev, // -> this is the previous state spreaded, see below     // the updates key(s) and value(s) go(es) here (this could be helpful, among other cases,     // when you need to update state relative to any previous state value.) } See a better explanation about this here. About the specific ...prev part. That’s called spread syntax, and it does exactly what the name suggests: takes an object, array, etc. and spreads it where you use the operator. You can find a really nice explanation with examples and all here. Next: chip8144226952: the array [name] key Oh, that’s no big deal. Simple as this: if you want to pass a string as an object key or value, then you just type it and then go like: const myClothes = {     winter: \"coat\" }  // Now I\\'ll access the key, like this: console.log(myClothes.winter); But how about if instead, I don’t know the key, I just know it’s stored in a variable? That’s when bracket notation (please read this, it will help and it has better examples) comes to the rescue. Let’s say that I don’t know what’s the season, because the user will enter that info in my app/website: const myClothes = {     summer: \"t-shirt\",     winter: \"coat\",     ... }  // And now the user entered \"summer\". How would I make sure that // the user gets a suggestion for clothing? How can I foresee it?   // With a variable that is assigned the value entered: const season = \\'summer\\'; console.log(myClothes[season]); // prints \"t-shirt\" // However, if I would say: console.log(myClothes.season) // there is no \"season\" key in the myClothes object, so it will complain with an error. :) I almost forgot ‘The parameter with curly brackets’. That I think is also object destructuring, right? Like I said above, you passed an object assigned as const target. Hope that makes sense by the time you reach here in your reading.
